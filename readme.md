> ### [Serverless-Framework MongoDB Node] codebase containing real world examples (CRUD, auth, advanced patterns, etc) that adheres to the [RealWorld](https://github.com/gothinkster/realworld) spec and API.


### [Demo](https://github.com/gothinkster/realworld)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[RealWorld](https://github.com/gothinkster/realworld)

This backend is a serverless-refactor of the [node express realworld example app](https://github.com/gothinkster/node-express-realworld-example-app). By comparing the two repo's you can see the difference between a serverless project and a traditional express app. So if you are a developer already familiar with Node and Express, and interested in Serverless, this is a perfect introduction for you.

This project was created to demonstrate taking a traditional node-express-mongodb/mongoose app fully Serverless using aws Lambda and API Gateway. It uses the [Serverless Framework](https://serverless.com/) to make deployment dead-simple and possible without leaving your editor.

This codebase was created to demonstrate a fully fledged fullstack application running with AWS Lambda & API Gateway instead of a Virtual Private Server & Express.js, including CRUD operations, authentication, routing, pagination, and more.

We've gone to great lengths to adhere to the **Serverless Framework** community styleguides & best practices.

# How it works

Most Serverless-tutorials will use Amazons DynamoDB or a SQL database, however this backend uses MongoDB Atlas. 




It works just like all the other Real World Apps!
